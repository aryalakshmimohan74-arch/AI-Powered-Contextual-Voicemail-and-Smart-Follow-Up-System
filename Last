Step 6. Integrate End-to-End Workflow
Combine components into a full pipeline:

Twilio webhook records voicemail.

Speech-to-text model transcribes it.

NLP pipeline classifies sentiment and intent.

Automation module sends email or SMS.

(Optional) Dashboard logs all interactions for tracking.

Step 7. Test and Deploy
Use Ngrok to tunnel your Flask server during local testing.

Register your webhook URL in Twilioâ€™s console.

Deploy on a small cloud instance (Heroku, Render, or AWS EC2).
